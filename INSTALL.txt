To compile CMPlayer, you need next things:

* g++ >= 4.7
* Qt >= 5.0
* yasm
* zlib
* libbz2
* libquvi
* libdvdread
* libcdio
* libcdio-paranoia
* libcdio-cdda
* libopenal
* libmpg123
* libasound (on Linux)
* libva (on Linux)


Also, you need VGA(graphics board) and driver which support OpenGL 2.0 or later.


Follow next steps to build and install CMPlayer:

- On Linux

There exist some package scripts to build .deb, .rpm or pkg.tar.xz(for Arch Linux).
You can modify and use theses ones to build your own package  for your system. 

If you want build cmplayer, follow next:

1. Run next command to build the libraries included in source tree,

$ ./build-libchardet && ./build-ffmpeg && ./build-mpv

2. Run next command to build cmplayer excutable,

$ make <args> cmplayer 

where <args> means arguments to build and install cmplayer succesufully .

Here's some usefule arguments:

PREFIX=<prefix>			CMPlayer will be built to install in <prefix> (default: /usr/local)
CXX=<cxx>				CMPlayer will be complied with the C++ compiler <cxx> (default:g++)
QMAKE=<qmake>		CMPlayer will be compiled with Qt which is proveded by the qmake <qmake> (default:qmake)
LRELEASE=<lrelease>	CMPlayer's translations will be generated with <lrelease> (default:lrelease)

You may build cmplayer with no argument if you're satisfied with the default values.

Now, you have the executable 'cmplayer' in build directory.
If you want to install cmplayer, proceed next.

3. To install cmplayer, run next command,

$ make <args> install

where you have to use exactly same <args> specified when building cmplayer.

- On OS X

1. Run next command to build the libraries included in source tree,

./build-libchardet && ./build-ffmpeg && ./build-mpv

2. Run next command to build cmplayer excutable,

make cmplayer 

Now you have the application bundle 'CMPlayer.app' on OS X in buid directory.
If you want to install cmplayer, All you have to is just copying the bundle into /Applications.
